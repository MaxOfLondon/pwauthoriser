# pwauthoriser
Planned Works Authoriser generates unique code that can be used as proof of authorisation to perform network maintenance activity. Codes are generated by privileged user and can be given to technician on the call. App works by packing bits and scrambling sequence to obfuscate. Codes are saved in sqlite db for tracking purposes. Program also allows unscrambling codes for validation.
